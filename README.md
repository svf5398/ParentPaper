This research paper applies machine learning techniques for autism spectrum disorder classification. The implementation platform used for this research paper is Python. Under the "Data" folder, you will find the four datasets used in the paper. I have also uploaded the jupyter notebooks from Google Colab that provide the code for feature engineering and machine learning models used on each dataset.
